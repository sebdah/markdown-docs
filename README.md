owl
===

Owl is a documentation generator for projects using Markdown. The problem with having Markdown files spread around your project is that it is hard to get an overview of all your documentation. Owl solves this by collecting all of your Markdown files into one browsable HTML hierarchy.

Features

- Adding [Table of contents](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html)

- Support for the [Markdown tables extension](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/tables.html)
